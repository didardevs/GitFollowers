# App Premise:

The user can enter a GitHub username and retrieve a list of that username's followers.
The user can search within these followers for a specific follower.
The user is able to tap on a follower from that list to get more information about that follower.
The user is able to save favorite username searches so they donâ€™t have to type them every time. This needs to persist between app launches.
